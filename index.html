      <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="lede">
    My name is Katie Ediger and I am a User Experience (UX) Librarian at the
    Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in the
    <a href="http://library.iit.edu">Paul V. Galvin Library</a>.
    I try to make the library's services and spaces more responsive to
    everyone's needs. As a librarian I spend a lot of my time helping people
    connect with and understand technology. At IIT, and previously at Northeastern
    Illinois University, I use <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> to
    manage the library's web presence.
  </p>

  <h2>Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>MLIS, <a href="https://sois.dom.edu/">Dominican Univeristy</a>, 2014</li>
    <li>BA Anthropology, <a href="https://www.beloit.edu/">Beloit College</a>, 2004</li>
  <p>
    I have a degree in Anthropology from <a href="https://www.beloit.edu/">
    Beloit College</a> and a Masters in Library and Information Science from
    <a href="https://sois.dom.edu/">Dominican University</a>. After completing
    my undergraduate degree, I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Peru. I
    lived and worked in a tiny town in the foothills of the Andes, called
    Laquipampa. When I came back to the United States, I knew that I wanted a
    career where I was working directly with people in some sort of service
    environment. I worked in several nonprofit positions before I found my
    calling as a librarian.
  </p>
  <p>
    I got my start in the library field at <a href="https://www.neiu.edu">
    Northeastern Illinois University</a> (NEIU). I managed the library at NEIU's
    El Centro campus. I also supported a wide range of departments, including
    Social Work, Computer Science, and Geography and Environmental Studies,
    through library instruction and collection development.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are normally a lot of moving parts, as
    well as many stakeholders, with an institutional website. At NEIU I worked
    with other librarians to do user testing for the
    <a href="https://www.neiu.edu/library/">library website</a>. Based on the
    testing, we made changes to better meet the needs of our university community.
    Watching people use the website and having them talk through their experiences
    was immensely helpful for seeing issues or problems with the site that we had
    never noticed before.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently working on a second masters degree in <a href="https://humansciences.iit.edu/humanities/programs/graduate-programs/master-science-technical-communication-and-information-architecture">information architecture
    and technical communication</a> from IIT. I'm in the program to advance my
    technical skills and to more formally study user experience. I am also
    excited to hear and understand perspectives outside of the library world.
    When I'm not at work or in class, you will probably find me roaming around
    Chicago looking for good food or exciting alley finds.
